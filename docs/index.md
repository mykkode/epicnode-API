#The ecosystem
Epicnode is a project that aims to provide an ecosystem where students can test their logic. It is opensource and it depends on
3 main systems.
 
- the first one is the API (the current documentation provides an overview of it) and it is built in PHP - Laravel
- the second one is the frontend which interacts with all the users and it is built in JS - Vue.js
- the third one is the server side which takes each job, executes it and return the result - it is built in C++
